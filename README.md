# Capstone Project - Lists, Functions, and String Handling

## Project Description

In this project, I used lists, dictionaries and functions to extend the functionality of a simple task management system. This is a program designed for a small business to help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of a team. This project aims to access my refactoring skills, refactoring code is done to reduce code complexity and ensure the readability of a teams functioning code so that other developers will not struggle to decipher the code.

## Installation

To install this project locally, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at. The git remote add command takes two arguments: A remote name, for example, origin. A remote URL, in this case, https://github.com/Yahya-H-Mohamed/finalCapstone.git 

## How-to

Once the project is installed, you will need to understand how it works. Once you run the program, you will face a login screen. You are expected to input a valid username and password. The admin account details are:
username = admin
password = password
After entering these details correctly you will have access to the commands in the program. These commands allow you to:
- Register a user
- Add a task
- View all tasks
- View all current users tasks
- Generate reports
- Display Statistics
- or exit the program
